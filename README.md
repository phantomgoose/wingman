# Wingman

This is a simple Rust CLI for interacting with OpenAI in a similar streaming chatbot fashion as ChatGPT (but in your terminal). Currently using GPT3.5-Turbo model.

You'll need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var in order to use the OpenAI API. You can get an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Run with `cargo run`.
